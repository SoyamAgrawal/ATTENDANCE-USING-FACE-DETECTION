1.Face detection: The system should be able to identify and detect the faces of the individuals who are trying to mark their attendance.

2.Face recognition: The system should be able to recognize the faces of the individuals and match them with the faces stored in the database.

3.Attendance marking: Once the system confirms the identity of the individual, it should mark their attendance automatically.

4.Database management: The system should maintain a database of all the employees or students for whom attendance needs to be recorded.

5.User interface: The system should have a user-friendly interface for administrators to manage the attendance records, add or remove employees/students, and generate reports.

Overall, the AI attendance system with face recognition can help organizations and institutions automate the attendance marking process, save time and resources, and reduce errors and fraud.
